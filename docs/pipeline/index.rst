Pipeline (`skypy.pipeline`)
***************************

The `~skypy.pipeline` package contains the functionality to run a SkyPy
simulation from end to end. This is implemented in the `~skypy.pipeline.Pipeline`
class and can be called using the :ref:`skypy command line script <skypy-script>`.


.. _skypy-script:

Running ``skypy`` from the command line
=======================================

``skypy`` is a command line script that runs a pipeline of functions defined in
a config file to generate tables of objects and write them to file. For example,
you can use ``skypy`` to run one of the `Examples`_ and write the outputs to
fits files:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ skypy examples/galaxies/sdss_photometry.yml --format fits

Config files are written in YAML format and read using the
`~skypy.pipeline.load_skypy_yaml` funciton. Each entry in the config specifices
an arbitrary variable, but there are also some particular fields that SkyPy uses:

- `parameters` : Variables that can be modified at execution
- `cosmology` : The cosmology to be used by functions within the pipeline
- `tables` : A dictionary of tables names, each resolving to a dictionary of column names for that table

Every variable can be assigned a fixed value as parsed by pyyaml_.
However, variables and columns can also be evaluated as functions. Fuctions are
defined as tuples where the first entry is the fully qualified function name
tagged with and exclamation mark ``!`` and the second entry is either a list
of positional arguments or a dictionary of keyword arguments. Variables
and columns in the pipeline can also be referenced by their full name tagged
with a dollar sign ``$``. For example:

.. literalinclude:: examples/config.yml
   :language: yaml
   :caption:

.. plot::
  :include-source: false

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from skypy.pipeline import Pipeline

    pipeline = Pipeline.read('examples/config.yml')
    pipeline.execute()

    z = pipeline['galaxies']['redshift']

    plt.hist(z, histtype='step', density=True, label='redshifts')
    plt.legend()
    plt.xlabel('redshift')

When executing a pipeline, all dependencies are tracked and resolved in order
using a Directed Acylic Graph implemented in networkx_.

Using a pipeline from other code
================================

SkyPy pipelines can be executed programmatically from other code. Consider the
following example configuration:

.. literalinclude:: examples/pipeline.yml
   :language: yaml
   :caption:

The `~skypy.pipeline.Pipeline` class can be used to load the configuration file
and run the resulting pipeline. If the configuration defines a `parameters`
section, the definition can be accessed and individual parameter values can be
changed for individual executions of the pipeline:

.. plot::

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from skypy.pipeline import Pipeline

    # read the example pipeline
    pipeline = Pipeline.read('examples/pipeline.yml')

    # run the pipeline as given
    pipeline.execute()

    # plot the results for the given parameters
    plt.hist(pipeline['galaxy-redshifts'], histtype='step', density=True,
             label='{:.2f}'.format(pipeline.parameters['median-redshift']))

    # change the median redshift parameter in a loop
    for z in [1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2.0]:

        # median redshift parameter
        parameters = {'median-redshift': z}

        # run pipeline with updated parameters
        pipeline.execute(parameters)

        # plot the new results
        plt.hist(pipeline['galaxy-redshifts'], histtype='step', density=True,
                 label='{:.2f}'.format(parameters['median-redshift']))

    # show plot labels
    plt.legend()
    plt.xlabel('redshift')
