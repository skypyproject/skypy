GitHub Workflow
---------------

Fork and Clone the SkyPy Repository
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**You should only need to do this step once**

First *fork* the SkyPy repository. A fork is your own remote copy of the repository on GitHub. To create a fork:

  1. Go to the `SkyPy GitHub Repository <https://github.com/skypyproject/skypy>`_
  2. Click the **Fork** button (in the top-right-hand corner)
  3. Choose where to create the fork, typically your personal GitHub account

Next *clone* your fork. Cloning creates a local copy of the repository on your computer to work with. To clone your fork:

::

   git clone https://github.com/<your-account>/skypy.git


Finally add the ``skypyproject`` repository as a *remote*. This will allow you to fetch changes made to the codebase. To add the ``skypyproject`` remote:

::

  cd skypy
  git remote add skypyproject https://github.com/skypyproject/skypy.git


Create a branch for your new feature
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Create a *branch* off the ``skypyproject`` master branch. Working on unique branches for each new feature simplifies the development, review and merge processes by maintining logical separation. To create a feature branch:

::

  git fetch skypyproject
  git checkout -b <your-branch-name> skypyproject/master


Hack away!
^^^^^^^^^^

Write the new code you would like to contribute and *commit* it to the feature branch on your local repository. Ideally commit small units of work often with clear and descriptive commit messages describing the changes you made. To commit changes to a file:

::

  git add file_containing_your_contribution
  git commit -m 'Your clear and descriptive commit message'


*Push* the contributions in your feature branch to your remote fork on GitHub:

::

  git push origin <your-branch-name>


**Note:** The first time you *push* a feature branch you will probably need to use `--set-upstream origin` to link to your remote fork:

::

  git push --set-upstream origin <your-branch-name>


Open a Pull Request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you feel that work on your new feature is complete, you should create a *Pull Request*. This will propose your work to be merged into the main SkyPy repository.

  1. Go to `SkyPy Pull Requests <https://github.com/skypyproject/skypy/pulls>`_
  2. Click the green **New pull request** button
  3. Click **compare across forks**
  4. Confirm that the base fork is ``skypyproject/skypy`` and the base branch is ``master``
  5. Confirm the head fork is ``<your-account>/skypy`` and the compare branch is ``<your-branch-name>``
  6. Give your pull request a title and fill out the the template for the description
  7. Click the green **Create pull request** button

Status checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A series of automated checks will be run on your pull request, some of which will be required to pass before it can be merged into the main codebase:

  - ``Tests`` (Required) runs the `unit tests`_ in four predefined environments; `latest supported versions`, `oldest supported versions`, `macOS latest supported` and `Windows latest supported`. Click "Details" to view the output including any failures.
  - ``codeclimate`` (Required) runs `pycodestyle <https://pycodestyle.pycqa.org/en/latest/>`_ to check that your code conforms to the `PEP 8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ style guidelines. Click "Details" to view any errors.
  - ``codecov`` reports the test coverage for your pull request; you should aim for `codecov/patch â€” 100.00%`. Click "Details" to view coverage data.
  - ``docs`` (Required) builds the `docstrings`_ on `readthedocs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_. Click "Details" to view the documentation or the failed build log.

Updating your branch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As you work on your feature, new commits might be made to the ``skypyproject`` master branch. You will need to update your branch with these new commits before your pull request can be accepted. You can achieve this in a few different ways:

  - If your pull request has no conflicts, click **Update branch**
  - If your pull request has conflicts, click **Resolve conflicts**, manually resolve the conflicts and click **Mark as resolved**
  - *merge* the ``skypyproject`` master branch from the command line:

    ::

        git fetch skypyproject
        git merge skypyproject/master

  - *rebase* your feature branch onto the ``skypyproject`` master branch from the command line:
    ::

        git fetch skypyproject
        git rebase skypyproject/master


**Warning**: It is bad practice to *rebase* commits that have already been pushed to a remote such as your fork. Rebasing creates new copies of your commits that can cause the local and remote branches to diverge. ``git push --force`` will **overwrite** the remote branch with your newly rebased local branch. This is strongly discouraged, particularly when working on a shared branch where you could erase a collaborators commits.

More Information

Coding Guidelines
-----------------

Before your pull request can be merged into the codebase, it will be reviewed by one of the SkyPy developers and required to pass a number of automated checks. Below are a minimum set of guidelines for developers to follow:

General Guidelines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- SkyPy is compatible with Python>=3.6 (see `setup.cfg <https://github.com/skypyproject/skypy/blob/master/setup.cfg>`_). SkyPy *does not* support backwards compatibility with Python 2.x; `six`, `__future__` and `2to3` should not be used.
- All contributions should follow the `PEP8 Style Guide for Python Code <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_. We recommend using `flake8 <https://flake8.pycqa.org/>`_ to check your code for PEP8 compliance.
- Importing SkyPy should only depend on having `NumPy <https://www.numpy.org>`_, `SciPy <https://www.scipy.org/>`_ and `Astropy <https://www.astropy.org/>`__ installed.
- Code is grouped into submodules based on broad science areas e.g. `galaxies <https://skypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/galaxies.html>`_. There is also a `utils <https://skypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/utils/index.html>`_ submodule for general utility functions.
- For more information see the `Astropy Coding Guidelines <http://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/development/codeguide.html>`_.

Unit Tests
^^^^^^^^^^

Pull requests will require existing unit tests to pass before they can be merged. Additionally, new unit tests should be written for all new public methods and functions. Unit tests for each submodule are contained in subdirectories called ``tests`` and you can run them locally using ``pytest``. For more information see the `Astropy Testing Guidelines <https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/development/testguide.html>`_.

If your unit tests check the statistical distribution of a random sample, the test outcome itself is a random variable, and the test will fail from time to time. Please mark such tests with the ``@pytest.mark.flaky`` decorator, so that they will be automatically tried again on failure. To prevent non-random test failures from being run multiple times, please isolate random statistical tests and deterministic tests in their own test cases.

Docstrings
^^^^^^^^^^

All public classes, methods and functions require docstrings. You can build documentation locally by installing `sphinx-astropy <https://github.com/astropy/sphinx-astropy>`_ and calling ``make html`` in the ``docs`` subdirectory. Docstrings should include the following sections:

  - Description
  - Parameters
  - Notes
  - Examples
  - References

For more information see the Astropy guide to `Writing Documentation <https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/development/docguide.html>`_.
