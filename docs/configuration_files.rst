Configuration Files
###################

This page outlines how to construct configuration files to run your own routines
with `~skypy.pipeline.Pipeline`.

`SkyPy` is an astrophysical simulation pipeline tool that allows to define any
arbitrary workflow and store data in table format. You may use `SkyPy` `~skypy.pipeline.Pipeline`
to call any function --your own implementation, from any compatible external software or from the `SkyPy library`.
Then `SkyPy` deals with the data dependencies and provides a library of functions to be used with it.

These guidelines start with an example using one of the `SkyPy` functions, and it follows
the concrete YAML syntax necessary for you to write your own configuration files, beyond using `SkyPy`
functions.

SkyPy example
-------------

In this section, we exemplify how you can write a configuration file and use some of the `SkyPy` functions.
In this example, we sample redshifts and magnitudes from the SkyPy luminosity function, `~skypy.galaxies.schechter_lf`.

- `Define variables`:

From the documentation, the parameters for the `~skypy.galaxies.schechter_lf` function are: ``redshift``, the characteristic absolute magnitude ``M_star``, the amplitude ``phi_star``, faint-end slope parameter ``alpha``,
the magnitude limit ``magnitude_limit``, the fraction of sky ``sky_area``, ``cosmology`` and ``noise``.
If you are planning to reuse some of these parameters, you can define them at the top-level of your configuration file.
In our example, we are using ``Astropy`` linear and exponential models for the characteristic absolute magnitude and the amplitude, respectively.
Also, ``noise`` is an optional parameter and you could use its default value by omitting its definition.

  .. code:: yaml

    cosmology: !astropy.cosmology.default_cosmology.get []
    z_range: !numpy.linspace [0, 2, 21]
    M_star: !astropy.modeling.models.Linear1D [-0.9, -20.4]
    phi_star: !astropy.modeling.models.Exponential1D [3e-3, -9.7]
    magnitude_limit: 23
    sky_area: 0.1 deg2

- `Tables and columns`:

You can create a table ``blue_galaxies`` and for now add the columns for redshift and magnitude (note here the ``schechter_lf`` returns a 2D object)

  .. code:: yaml

    tables:
      blue_galaxies:
        redshift, magnitude: !skypy.galaxies.schechter_lf
          redshift: $z_range
      	  M_star: $M_star
      	  phi_star: $phi_star
      	  alpha: -1.3
      	  m_lim: $magnitude_limit
      	  sky_area: $sky_area

`Important:` if cosmology is detected as a parameter but is not set, it automatically uses the cosmology variable defined at the top-level of the file.

This is how the entire configuration file looks like!

.. literalinclude:: luminosity.yml
   :language: yaml

You may now save it as ``luminosity.yml`` and run it using the `SkyPy` `~skypy.pipeline.Pipeline`:

.. plot::
   :include-source: true
   :context: close-figs

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from skypy.pipeline import Pipeline

    # Execute SkyPy luminosity pipeline
    pipeline = Pipeline.read("luminosity.yml")
    pipeline.execute()

    # Blue population
    skypy_galaxies = pipeline['blue_galaxies']

    # Plot histograms
    fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(9, 3))

    axs[0].hist(skypy_galaxies['redshift'], bins=50, histtype='step', color='purple')
    axs[0].set_xlabel(r'$Redshift$')
    axs[0].set_ylabel(r'$\mathrm{N}$')
    axs[0].set_yscale('log')

    axs[1].hist(skypy_galaxies['magnitude'], bins=50, histtype='step', color='green')
    axs[1].set_xlabel(r'$Magnitude$')
    axs[1].set_yscale('log')

    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()

You can also run the pipeline directly from the command line and write the outputs to a fits file:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ skypy luminosity.yml luminosity.fits

YAML syntax
-----------
YAML_ is a file format designed to be readable by both computers and humans.
Fundamentally, a file written in YAML consists of a set of key-value pairs.
Each pair is written as ``key: value``, where whitespace after the ``:`` is optional.
The hash character ``#`` denotes the start of a comment and all further text on that
line is ignored by the parser.


This guide introduces the main syntax of YAML relevant when writing
a configuration file to use with ``SkyPy``. Essentially, it begins with
definitions of individual variables at the top level, followed by the tables,
and, within the table entries, the features of objects to simulate are included.
Main keywords: ``parameters``, ``cosmology``, ``tables``.


Variables
^^^^^^^^^
* `Variable definition`: a variable is defined as a key-value pair at the top of the file.
  YAML is able to interpret any numeric data with the appropriate type: integer, float, boolean.
  Similarly for lists and dictionaries.
  In addition, SkyPy has added extra functionality to interpret and store Astropy Quantities_.
  Everything else is stored as a string (with or without explicitly using quotes)

  .. code:: yaml

      # YAML interprets
      counter: 100 # An integer
      miles: 1000.0 # A floating point
      name: "Joy" # A string
      planet: Earth # Another string
      mylist: [ 'abc', 789, 2.0e3 ] # A list
      mydict: { 'fruit': 'orange', 'year': 2020 } # A dictionary

      # SkyPy extra functionality
      angle: 10 deg
      distance: 300 kpc


* `Import objects`:
  the SkyPy configuration syntax allows objects to be imported directly from external
  (sub)modules using the ``!`` tag and providing neither a list of arguments or a
  dictionary of keywords. For example, this enables the import and usage of any Astropy cosmology:

  .. code:: yaml

      cosmology: !astropy.cosmology.Planck13 # import the Planck13 object and bind it to the variable named "cosmology"


Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^

* `Parameters definition`: parameters are variables that can be modified at execution.

  For example,

  .. code:: yaml

      parameters:
        hubble_constant: 70
        omega_matter: 0.3


Functions
^^^^^^^^^
* `Function call`: functions are defined as tuples where the first entry is the fully qualified function name tagged with and exclamation mark ``!`` and the second entry is either a list of positional arguments or a dictionary of keyword arguments.

  For example, if you need to call the ``log10()`` and ``linspace()`` NumPy_ functions, then you define the following key-value pairs:

  .. code:: yaml

      log_of_2: !numpy.log10 [2]
      myarray: !numpy.linspace [0, 2.5, 10]

  You can also define parameters of functions with a dictionary of keyword arguments.
  Imagine you want to compute the comoving distance for a range of redshifts and an `Astropy` Planck 2015 cosmology.
  To run it with the `SkyPy` pipeline, call the function and define the parameters as an indented dictionary.

  .. code:: yaml

      comoving_distance: !astropy.cosmology.Planck15.comoving_distance
        z: !numpy.linspace [ 0, 1.3, 10 ]

  Similarly, you can specify the functions arguments as a dictionary:

  .. code:: yaml

      comoving_distance: !astropy.cosmology.Planck15.comoving_distance
        z: !numpy.linspace {start: 0, stop: 1.3, num: 10}

  `N.B.` To call a function with no arguments, you should pass an empty list of
  ``args`` or an empty dictionary of ``kwargs``. For example:

  .. code:: yaml

      cosmo: !astropy.cosmology.default_cosmology.get []


* `Variable reference`: variables can be referenced by their full name tagged with a dollar sign ``$``.
  In the previous example you could also define the variables at the top-level of the file and then reference them:

  .. code:: yaml

      redshift: !numpy.linspace [ 0, 1.3, 10 ]
      comoving_distance: !astropy.cosmology.Planck15.comoving_distance
        z: $redshift

* The `cosmology` to be used by functions within the pipeline only needs to be set up at the top. If a function needs ``cosmology`` as an input, you need not define it again, it is automatically detected.

  For example, calculate the angular size of a galaxy with a given physical size, at a fixed redshift and for a given cosmology:

  .. code:: yaml

      cosmology: !astropy.cosmology.FlatLambdaCDM
        H0: 70
        Om0: 0.3
      size: !skypy.galaxies.morphology.angular_size
        physical_size: 10 kpc
        redshift: 0.2

* `Job completion`: ``.depends`` can be used to force any function call to wait for completion
  of any other job.

  A simple example where, for some reason, the comoving distance needs to be called after
  completion of the angular size function:

  .. code:: yaml

    cosmology: !astropy.cosmology.Planck15
    size: !skypy.galaxies.morphology.angular_size
      physical_size: 10 kpc
      redshift: 0.2
    comoving_distance: !astropy.cosmology.Planck15.comoving_distance
      z: !numpy.linspace [ 0, 1.3, 10 ]
      .depends: size

  By doing so, you force the function call ``redshift`` to be completed before is used to compute the comoving distance.


Tables
^^^^^^

* `Table creation`: a dictionary of table names, each resolving to a dictionary of column names for that table.

  Let us create a table called ``telescope`` with a column to store the width of spectral lines that follow a normal distribution

  .. code:: yaml

      tables:
        telescope:
          spectral_lines: !scipy.stats.norm.rvs
            loc: 550
            scale: 1.6
            size: 100

* `Column addition`: you can add as many columns to a table as you need.
    Imagine you want to add a column for the telescope collecting surface

  .. code:: yaml

      tables:
        telescope:
          spectral_lines: !scipy.stats.norm.rvs
            loc: 550
            scale: 1.6
            size: 100
          collecting_surface: !numpy.random.uniform
            low: 6.9
            high: 7.1
            size: 100

* `Column reference`: columns in the pipeline can be referenced by their full name tagged with a dollar sign ``$``.
  Example: the galaxy mass that follows a lognormal distribution. You can create a table ``galaxies``
  with a column ``mass`` where you sample 10000 object and a second column, ``radius`` which also follows a lognormal distribution
  but the mean depends on how massive the galaxies are:

  .. code:: yaml

    tables:
      galaxies:
        mass: !numpy.random.lognormal
          mean: 5.
          size: 10000
        radius: !numpy.random.lognormal
          mean: $galaxies.mass


* `Multi-column assignment`: multi-column assignment is performed with any 2d-array, where one of the dimensions is interpreted
  as the rows of the table and the second dimension, as separate columns. Or you can do it from a function that returns a tuple.

  We use multi-column assignment in the following example where we sample a two-dimensional array of values from a lognormal distribution and then store them as three columns in a table:

  .. code:: yaml

    tables:
      halos:
        mass, radius, concentration: !numpy.random.lognormal
          size: [10000, 3]


* `Table initialisation`: by default tables are initialised using ``astropy.table.Table()`` however this can be overridden using the ``.init`` keyword to initialise the table with any function call.

  For example, you can stack galaxy properties such as radii and mass:

  .. code:: yaml

    radii: !numpy.logspace [ 1, 2, 100 ]
    mass: !numpy.logspace [ 9, 12, 100 ]
    tables:
      galaxies:
        .init: !astropy.table.vstack [[ $radii, $mass ]]


* `Table reference`: when a function call depends on tables, you need to ensure the referenced table has the necessary content and is not empty.
  You can do that with ``.complete``.

  Example: you want to perform a very simple abundance matching, i.e. painting galaxies within your halos.
  You can create two tables ``halos`` and ``galaxies`` storing the halo mass and galaxy luminosities.
  Then you can stack these two tables and store it in a third table called ``matching``.

  .. code:: yaml

    tables:
      halos:
        halo_mass: !numpy.random.uniform
          low: 1.0e8
          high: 1.0e14
          size: 20
      galaxies:
        luminosity: !numpy.random.uniform
          low: 0.05
          high: 10.0
          size: 20
      matching:
        .init: !astropy.table.hstack
          tables: [ $halos, $galaxies ]
          .depends: [ halos.complete, galaxies.complete ]
